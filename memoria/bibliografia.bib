  	abstract = {Location is the most important strategic decision in retailing. The location problem is markedly complex and multicriteria. One of the key factors to consider is the so-called balanced tenancy - i.e., the degree to which neighboring businesses complement each other. There are several network-based methodologies that formalize the notion of balanced tenancy by capturing the spatial interactions between different commercial sectors in cities. Some of these methodologies provide indices that have been successfully used as input features in location recommendation systems. However, from a predictive perspective, it is still unknown which of the indices provides best results. In this work, we analyze the performance of six of these indices on a set of nine Spanish cities. Our results show that the combined use of all of them in an ensemble model such as random forest significantly improves predictive accuracy. In addition, we explore the effect of knowledge transfer between cities from two different perspectives: 1) quantify how much the quality of solutions degrades when the balanced tenancy of a city is explored through the indices obtained from another city; 2) investigate the interest of network consensus approaches for knowledge transfer in retailing.},

  	abstract = {The problem of location is the cornerstone of strategic decisions in retail management. This decision is usually complex and multidimensional. One of the most relevant success factors is an adequate balanced tenancy, i.e., a complementary ecosystem of retail stores in the surroundings, both in planned and unplanned areas. In this paper, we use network theory to analyze the commercial spatial interactions in all the cities of Castile and Leon (an autonomous community in north-western Spain), Madrid, and Barcelona. Our approach encompasses different proposals both for the definition of the interaction networks and for their subsequent analyses. These methodologies can be used as pre-processing tools to capture features that formalize the relational dimension for location recommendation systems. Our results unveil the retail structure of different urban areas and enable a meaningful comparison between cities and methodologies. In addition, by means of consensus techniques, we identify a robust core of commercial relationships, independent of the particularities of each city, and thus help to distinguish transferable knowledge between cities. The results also suggest greater specialization of commercial space with city size.},

   abstract = {Retailers are the most powerful actors of the distribution channels with proximity to consumers and potential to create market. Retail store site selection is a strategic decision, both in terms of customer satisfaction and profitability of the company to changing market conditions and intense competition. Retail site selection decision is a long-term investment. Long-term investment decisions are difficult and costly to change. Retail store site selection is a process that must be followed carefully in order to pass ahead of the competition. In this process, election-related data collection and scientific analysis, and decisions must be made in the light of these data. Therefore, in the process of taking decisions managers use scientific methods to provide significant benefits in decision making. Administrators must also consider the combination of several criteria in the selection of retail store location. This problem is complex and has multi-criteria decision-making structure. Such a decision can be modelled analytically. In this study, selection of retail store concept in the literature has been identified, the studies that has been dealt with the problem of the selection of retail store, were examined. A retail store location selection criteria was defined. Selection model was established with the AHP method. The study was applied in the Aygin Milk Inc. The aim of the study, for the managers of the company to decide to use both qualitative and quantitative approach. The goal is to choose the most appropriate location of retail stores in real business life.},
